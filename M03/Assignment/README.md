# Generics

### Instructions

In this assignment, you will implement several Generics concepts. 

### Task 1 
Steps:
1. Create a simple example of a mutableList that takes strings as parameters. 
2. Try adding an integer to the list and see what happens and fix any potential issues.

### Task 2
Steps:
1. Create a class that accepts a particular type. 
2. Define the class and the type and see what happens when you pass an object that is of type other than the given one. 

### Task 3
Steps:
1. Create a Function that can specify the type of arguments it can accept
2. Check to see what happens if you pass on object that is not of this type. 

### Task 4
Steps
1. Create a function that returns a certain type 
2. Expose this function to another class which can then directly call this function and retrive the object
returned by the function

### Task 5
Steps
1. Enforce Generic Constraints by creating a class and denoting the type of objects it can hold. 
2. To finish this task 5, create a class Phone that only accepts objects of type CellularService. 

### Task 6
Steps
1. Enforce restricted types for a class to related types of objects. 
2. To finish task 6, after task 5, refactor class Phone so that it can accept two types of CellularService
like TMobile and Verizon. 

### Task 7
Steps
1. Create an observable that emits 3 objects of type Int
2. To finish this task, you will need to import rxjava, rxAndroid dependencies using gradle. 

### Task 8
Steps
1. Create an observable that emits objects of a custom data class Actor
2. To finish this task, create two actors Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and return these objects using an observable.

### Task 9
Steps
1. Create a dummy network API like the one in the guided project to return four movies with custom attributes such as
year of release, title, language, imdb rating (feel free to be creative here!, you will need to 
create a data class for Movie to start this task)
2. Make a call to this NetworkAPI to fetch the movie data and then observe the response and print it to the console.
